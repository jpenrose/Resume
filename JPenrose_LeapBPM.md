Professional graphic designer who has found my real passion is working with stakeholders to manage projects. I love to learn and, after a 12 year career break, I have been diligently studying project/program management skills. I am very excited for the opportunity to be considered for this apprenticeship where I can learn how to become a successful Microsoft Business Program Manager.

Excellent communication skills and high emotional intelligence help me to collaborate well with others. I believe strongly in personal integrity and personal accountability for my words and actions. I respect and value differences in all people. I am adaptable to change and a creative problem solver. I find satisfaction in empowering and facilitating others in their ability to meet project goals.

I would be thrilled to bring my passion and skill set to learn successfully at the Business Program Management Apprenticeship Program with Microsoft Leap.
